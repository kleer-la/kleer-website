Additionally, the business is not neglected as we works directly on the projects, roles and objectives of the teams and other stakeholders involved in the implementation (managers, development managers, etc.). This includes identifying problems, understanding their causes and developing the skills necessary for the team to be able to solve them successfully.</p><p>There are two kinds of situations: those in which never before had and agile environment been created and and others in which Agile already exists and you want to experience a greater level of depth.

It is not a complete process, much less a methodology. Instead of providing a complete and detailed description of how the project tasks should be performed, it generates a relational and iterative context, of inspection and constant adaptation where those involved are to create their own process."

Organizations and teams are composed of people, and people have behaviours, emotions, desires, and their own history. If, instead of minimising these factors, we embrace them and included them in management, we’ll soon begin to witness dramatic improvements.<br/><br/> Performance is not just about how much is produced, but how effective are the personal relationships in the new professional context. The formula is simple: <strong>R = R (Result = Relationships)</strong>. This means that the most effective way to improve outcomes is to improve relations between the members of a team and not just taking care of the processes and the tasks they perform.<br/><br/>But in this trip there will be a lot of challenges. To facilitate it, I decided to take the best of both worlds, Scrum and Coaching, and combine them in a novel way to make the teams to expose their spirit. by getting immersed in this reading, you will find experiences, innovative proposals, recommendations and useful description of a complete framework for knowledge workers.<br/><br/>This is a key moment in the history of the world of work.
